# Atomic Deployments with CircleCI

A one endpont Flask app that accompanies this [this blog post]() in demonstrating how to deploy a Python app atomically via CircleCI. The real meat and potatoes are in [deployment/atomic_deployments.sh](https://github.com/builtbykrit/atomic-deployments-with-circleci/blob/master/deployment/atomic_deployments.sh) and [circle.yml](https://github.com/builtbykrit/atomic-deployments-with-circleci/blob/master/circle.yml).
